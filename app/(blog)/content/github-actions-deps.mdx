  How to streamline development and CI dependencies with GitHub 
  Actions and Nix flakes, automatically merging dependency updates
  from Dependabot and GitHub Actions.

I find GitHub Actions relatively easy to use, but testing workflows locally is 
hard, and the YAML syntax feels weird. The evaluation expressions make me think
they should have just used Nix instead. That said, I don't have much experience
with CI workflows and pipelines beyond GitHub Actions and Jenkins. While we 
can't use Nix directly to define our workflows, we can run Nix in different ways
within them.

Managing dependencies across development and CI environments can be tedious, 
especially when juggling multiple tools and package managers. While GitHub 
Actions provides a solid automation platform, testing workflows locally remains
challenging, as it uses an impure declarative approach.

If you want to use Nix in CI, you'll likely find yourself manually updating the
flake.lock file to keep up with development. There's an update-flake-lock action
that automates this by creating a pull request instead of pushing changes
directly. It's not a big deal, but since the action provides the
`outputs.pull-request-url`, we probably want to use it to merge automatically
using the GITHUB_TOKEN.

Here's an example workflow that uses Nix along with update-flake-lock to update
dependencies and merge the generated PR automatically:

```yml filename=update-flake-lock.yml
name: update-flake-lock

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"

jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      pr_url: ${{ steps.update-lock.outputs.pull-request-url }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Nix
        uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main

      - name: Update flake.lock
        id: update-lock
        uses: DeterminateSystems/update-flake-lock@main
        with:
          pr-title: "Update flake.lock"
          pr-labels: |
            dependencies
            automated

  squash-to-master:
    needs: update
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: needs.update.outputs.pr_url != ''
    steps:
      - name: Merge Pull Request
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PR_URL: ${{ needs.update.outputs.pr_url }}
        run: |
          gh pr view "$PR_URL" --json author --jq '.author.login == "app/github-actions"' &&
          gh pr merge "$PR_URL" --squash --delete-branch
```

For this workflow to run correctly, you need to enable
Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions > Allow GitHub Actions to
create and approve pull requests and set the permissions to Read and write.

The workflow is simple: set up Nix, run update-flake-lock, and then—since the 
update job is required by squash-to-master—we can reference the outputs.pr_url
provided by the action to merge the pull request using the GitHub CLI and 
`GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Another approach is to use an auto-merge workflow, but be aware that workflows 
cannot be triggered by pull requests created by other GitHub Actions
[see discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/65321).

Now, what about dependencies outside of Nix, a package.json? I won't go into
detail about Dependabot, but basically, it's a service that identifies outdated
dependencies or vulnerabilities in your repository. However, Dependabot doesn't
merge pull requests automatically either.

Here's a workflow that merges pull requests created by both other actions and 
Dependabot. As mentioned before, it cannot merge PRs made within the GitHub CLI.

```yml filename=.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml
name: auto merge

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  squash-to-master:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ contains(fromJson('["dependabot[bot]", "github-actions[bot]"]'), github.actor) }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Squash to master
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PR_URL: ${{github.event.pull_request.html_url}}
        run: |
          echo "merging ${PR_URL}"
          gh pr merge "$PR_URL" --squash --delete-branch
```
