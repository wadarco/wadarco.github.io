Terminal-based file managers offer numerous practical use cases. They
are particularly valuable for users who prefer to work entirely within
the terminal, eliminating the need to switch to a GUI application
just to browse a file tree or preview some files.

They are also part of the minimal install linux rice subculture.
When I first started with Arch Linux, URXVT (rxvt-unicode) was the
go-to terminal emulator, Many users customized their setups with tools
like pywal to synchronize colors across their desktops at the same
time, Ranger was the most popular file manager.

Although pywal has since been archived and URXVT has largely fallen out
of use, several new terminal-based file managers have emerged that I'd
like to discuss.

### lf (as in "list files")

The main reason for choosing lf over other tools is its simplicity.
It comes with Vim keybindings by default and allows users to extend its
functionality through custom scripts.

`lf` searches for the configuration file in the user's config directory at
`$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/lf/lfrc`. However, you can specify a different location
using the `-config` flag.

```bash filename=~/.config/lf/lfrc
set shell fish
set shellopts '-eu'

# leave some space at the top and the bottom of the screen
set scrolloff 10

# make sure trash folder exists
%mkdir -p ~/.local/share/Trash/files

# move current file or selected files to trash folder
cmd trash %set -f; mv $fx ~/.local/share/Trash/files

# compress current file or selected files with zip
cmd zip ${{
    set -f
    mkdir $1
    cp -r $fx $1
    zip -r $1.zip $1
    rm -rf $1
}}
```

The example file can be found in `/usr/share/doc/lf/lfrc.example` or the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/blob/master/etc/lfrc.example).

### File Preview

To write the previewer script, ensure you understand the five arguments
passed to it:

1. File: $1 (file path)
2. Width: $2 (previewer's width)
3. Height: $3 (previewer's height)
4. Left: $4 (margion of the previewer from left)
5. Top: $5 (margion of the previewer from top)

Additionally, you can run `lf` with the -debug flag to generate a log
file, which can be helpful for troubleshooting purposes.

```bash
lf -log /tmp/lf_log
```

Some files may require thumbnails. For more details, consider reviewing the
[freedesktop specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/latest/)

For images and cover my recommendation is to use the
[kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).

```fish filename=~/.config/lf/preview
#!/usr/bin/env fish

set thumbnail (printf "$XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails/large/%s.png" (echo -n "file://$argv[1]"| md5sum| awk '{print $1}'))

mkdir -p $XDG_CACHE_HOME/thumbnails/large/

function preview_image
    kitty +kitten icat --stdin no --transfer-mode file --place \
        {$argv[2]}x{$argv[3]}@{$argv[4]}x{$argv[5]} $argv[1] >/dev/tty
    exit 1
end


switch (file --dereference --brief --mime-type $argv[1])
    case "application/x-tar"
        tar tf $argv[1]

    case "application/zip"
        unzip -l $argv[1]

    case "audio/flac"
        if test ! -f $thumbnail; metaflac --export-picture-to=$thumbnail $argv[1]; end
        preview_image $thumbnail $argv[2] $argv[3] $argv[4] $argv[5]

    case "video/*"
        if test ! -f $thumbnail; ffmpeg -i $argv[1] -vframes 1 $thumbnail; end
        preview_image $thumbnail $argv[2] $argv[3] $argv[4] $argv[5]

    case "image/*"
        preview_image $argv

    case "*"
        bat -p -f $argv[1]
end
```

### Yazi

Yazi is by far the most well-documented option. It features
comprehensive [documentation](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/quick-start),
numerous YouTube videos—even beyond the Linux community—and various
plugins to help users understand how to create their own.

To install a `Flavor` which is a pre-made theme, yazi comes with a
package manager.

```bash
# Installing catppuccin-mocha.yazi
ya pack -a yazi-rs/flavors:catppuccin-mocha
```

```toml filename=~/.config/yazi/theme.toml
[flavor]
use = "catppuccin-mocha"
```

You can also clone the directory using Git, but the package manager is
capable of updating all plugins and flavors at once.

```bash
ya pack -u
```

Be sure to back up the packages.toml file in your dotfiles. This
ensures Yazi can reinstall and update your plugins seamlessly.

Yazi can preview most common file types, but for others, you'll need to
install a plugin. This process is a bit more challenging compared to lf
because Yazi uses Lua instead of shell scripts. However, there are already
many plugins you can install.

### Conclusion

I find Yazi more enjoyable and faster to use than lf, although there are a
few considerations to keep in mind.

Since Yazi is designed to implement multiple protocols, you can't take full
advantage of Kitty's features. Additionally, Yazi generates optimized
versions of images at lower quality to help with performance, but this
doesn't mean that implementing similar optimizations in lf would be slow;
the quality loss is noticeable.

Currently, the version in Nixpkgs does not support alpha channels for
PNGs, and I'm unsure if animation support will ever be implemented.

On the bright side, Yazi is under active development, and if you run the
latest commit, the PNG images caching has been fixed:

```bash
nix registry add yazi github:sxyazi/yazi
nix profile install yazi
```

For now, I prefer using Yazi, as it generally works better within tmux.
