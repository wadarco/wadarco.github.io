Welcome to My Blog!

I've been wanting to create this blog for a while now. I used to have
a blog back in 2019, but, unfortunately, I lost it when I deleted my
Heroku account.

When planning this blog, I initially considered using Astro.
Honestly, it's not my preferred choice for blogging. While I
appreciate Astro, I don't feel like building a blog with it, I wanted
the flexibility to build my own content loader using Effect-ts, MDX
and Rehype.

I also considerate SvelteKit and SolidStart, but in the end, I chose
to go with Next.js. It's the framework I'm most comfortable with, also
don't want to worry a lot about the framework.

As I said for this project, I'll be using Effect-ts. Although I have
some reservations about the ecosystem, I believe it will be suitable
for a personal project like this.

As for the blog's content, I'll mainly focus on web development and Linux.
However, don't be surprised if I end up writing about retro games from
time to timeâ€”they're a passion of mine, too!
